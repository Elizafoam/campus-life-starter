                <p>Problems began around 0700 UTC on June 4, and by 0721 UTC the biz admitted that something was amiss and it was investigating. Just over an hour later, OpenAI reckoned it had worked out what was wrong and was "mitigating." As of 1000 UTC, it told users it was "continuing to work on a fix for this issue."</p>
